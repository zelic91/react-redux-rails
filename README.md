# zreact-redux-rails

I firstly created this gem for my own usage. However, when I pushed this gem, another gem with the same name, but seemed quite old appeared. I decided to make another gem for up-to-date components.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'zreact-redux-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install react-redux-rails

## Usage

Simply add below lines to your `application.js` on your behalf:

```ruby
//= require react-redux
```

Or if you are using CoffeeScript, it's your `application.js.coffee`:

```ruby
#= require react-redux
```

## Versioning

`react-redux-rails` has the same version number as `redux` (we don't care about react-redux version at all).
