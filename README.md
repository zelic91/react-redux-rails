# react-redux-rails

I searched around the Internet to see if there is any Redux gem for my simple React Rails app using `react-rails` gem, and I found nothing (I know, I know that you have better options). So yeah, here it is.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'react-redux-rails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install react-redux-rails

## Usage

Simply add below lines to your `application.js` on your behalf:

```ruby
//= require redux
//= require react-redux
```

Or if you are using CoffeeScript, it's your `application.js.coffee`:

```ruby
#= require redux
#= require react-redux
```

## Versioning

`react-redux-rails` has the same version number as `redux` (we don't care about react-redux version at all).
